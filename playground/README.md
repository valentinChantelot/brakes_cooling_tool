## Usage

### Method 1: Using http-server

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
2. Install `http-server` globally by running `npm install -g http-server`.
3. Clone or download this repository.
4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
5. Run `http-server .` to start the server.
6. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to use the Fibonacci Calculator 3000.

### Method 2: Disabling CORS Protections

If you prefer not to use `http-server`, you can disable CORS protections in your web browser to run the application directly:

- For **Google Chrome**, you can use the `--disable-web-security` flag.
- For **Mozilla Firefox**, you can install the [CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/) extension.

Please note that disabling CORS protections can have security implications. Use it only for local development purposes.
